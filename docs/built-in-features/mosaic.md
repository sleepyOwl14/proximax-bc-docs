Mosaics are part of what makes the Smart Asset System unique and flexible. They are **fixed assets** on the NEM blockchain that can represent a set of multiple identical things that do not change.

A mosaic could be a token, but it could also be a collection of more specialized assets such as reward points, shares of stock, signatures, status flags, votes or even other currencies.

Each mosaic has a set of configurable properties. During the mosaic creation, you can define:

**Property** |	**Type** |	**Description**
-------------|-----------|--------------------
Divisibility |	Integer |	Determines up to what decimal place the mosaic can be divided. Divisibility of 3 means that a mosaic can be divided into smallest parts of 0.001 mosaics. The divisibility must be in the range of 0 and `6`.
Duration |	Integer |	Specifies the number of confirmed blocks the mosaic is rented for. Mosaics can be configured to not expire.
Initial supply |	Integer |	Indicates the amount of mosaic in circulation. The initial supply must be in the range of 0 and `9,000,000,000`.
Supply mutable |	Boolean |	If set to true, the mosaic supply can change at a later point. Otherwise, the mosaic supply remains immutable.
Transferability |	Boolean |	If set to true, the mosaic can be transferred between arbitrary accounts. Otherwise, the mosaic can be only transferred back to the mosaic creator.

## Guides

**Note**

⚠ The latest release introduces breaking changes. Until the SDKs are not aligned, we recommend using [catapult-service-bootstrap 0.1.0](../getting-started/setting-up-workstation.md) to run the guides.

</diV>

- [Creating a mosaic](../guides/mosaic/creating-a-mosaic.md)

    After creating a namespace, follow this guide to create a mosaic .

- [Modifying mosaic supply](../guides/mosaic/modifying-mosaic-supply.md)

    Did you register a mosaic with supplyMutable option set to true? In that case, you can increase or decrease your mosaic available supply following this guide.
