The Sirius-Chain Software Development Kit is the primary software development tool to create chain components, such as additional tools, libraries or applications. Almost all, if not all, components should use **XPX-Chain-SDK** instead of raw API.

**Warning**

The SDKs methods could change until it reaches the stable version 1.0.0.

The new SDK enables developers to focus on their product rather than on the Sirius-Chain specific API details due to its higher abstraction.

XPX-Chain-SDK shares the same design/architecture between programming languages to accomplish the next properties:

- **Fast language adaptation**: There is a library for Java, but you need it for C# for example. As both SDKs share the same design, you can re-write the library faster, adapting the syntax to your language. It also applies to examples, projects, applications…
- **Cohesion/shared knowledge cross Sirius-Chain developers**: Be able to change between projects that use Sirius-Chain, sharing the same design accompanied by the best practices.
- **Fast SDK updates**: Migrating any improvement from a XPX-Chain-SDK implementation to the rest is faster.
- **Fewer bugs**: If any bug appears in one language, it is faster to check and fix it.

The best way to learn about the SDKs is through [guides](../built-in-features/account.md).
