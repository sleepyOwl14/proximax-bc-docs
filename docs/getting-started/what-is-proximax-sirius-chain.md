## Blockchain Reimagined and Evolved

[ProximaX](https://proximax.io/) Sirius-chain is a blockchain component under ProximaX Sirius platform built from the ground up to be simple for developers to use blockchain technology.

Sirius-Chain is built around a powerful system to customize your using of the blockchain. We call it the Smart Asset System. It gives you the power to use Sirius Chain as if it were a custom blockchain built for your application and your assets.

Rather than force you to write your own “smart contract” code from scratch or use off-blockchain methods that define custom assets for you application, Sirius-Chain gives you direct access to a specialized set of tested and secure on-blockchain features.

Sirius-Chain is suitable for an amazing variety of solutions of different classes, such as direct public transactions via a streamlined smartphone app, efficient cloud services that connect client or web applications, or a high-performance permissioned enterprise back-end for business-critical record keeping.

## Architecting on Sirius-Chain

Sirius-Chain [nodes](../protocol/node.md) provide a powerful, stable and secure platform where smart asset transactions are conducted, searched, and immutably logged to the blockchain ledger.

All the features are available through the API interface on each node in the network itself. This means that the blockchain can be used to create a variety of architecture solutions with lightweight [code in any language](../sdks/languages.md).

**Mobile app direct access** 

A lightweight app directly interfaces to blockchain features.

**Client/server model** 

A gateway server manages blockchain usage for a client app or web service.

**Legacy system integration**

A gateway server links existing business contract logic, systems, or databases to the blockchain ledger.

## Public and Private

Sirius-Chain provides both a decentralized, open and self-sustaining **public blockchain** that can be used by anyone – as well as a **permissioned/private blockchain solution** that can be provisioned specifically for your use on your servers when speed and privacy are the priority.
